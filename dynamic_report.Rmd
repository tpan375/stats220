## Spotting Red: People, Clothing, and Groups

In my code and bar charts we can see that the summary values showed a minimum of 1 person wearing red in the past 10 minutes while the maximum was 12. The mean amount of people seen wearing red was observed to be 4.85. 

The summary values of how many people wearing red were in groups of at least 2 showed that the minimum observed was 0 while the maximum was 7. The mean was fairly low with a value of 2.5 which shows that there was usually half of the observed people wearing red were in groups of at least 2.

In the first bar chart the most commonly observed piece of clothing that was red was t-shirts. With the lowest being accessories, pants/skirts and shoes.
